  "storyline": "During the last days of World War I, a soldier saves the life of a pilot. While fleeing the enemy they are involved in a crash and the soldier loses his memory. After being released from the hospital he opens a barber shop in a Jewish Ghetto. He bear a strong resemblance the the dictator of his country of Tomania, Adenoid Hynkel. His story is followed through arrests, mishaps, and being sent to a concentration camp. Strong allegory to World War II which was underway when the movie was produced."
